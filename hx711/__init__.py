class HX711:
    """
    Provide basic driver services for the HX711 load cell amplifier/ADC

    This subclass includes a GPIO bit-bang implemenation of the HX711 two-wire serial protocol using
    two GPIO pins, one for data and one for clock.

    :param gain int: Gain/channel setting for ADC readings. Defaults to :const:`1`
    :param offset int: Zero-offset to apply to readings. Defaults to :const:`0`
    :param float scalar: Scalar to use for conversion of ADC counts to units. Defaults to :const:`1`
    :param bool tare: If true, perform ``tare()`` on instantiation. Defaults to :const:`False`


    **Quickstart: Importing and using the HX711**

        Here is an example of using the :class:`HX711` class.

        First you will need to import the specific library subclass you'd like to use to access
        the sensor

        .. code-block:: python

            import board
            from hx711.hx711_gpio import HX711_GPIO

        Once this is done you can define your ``DigitalInOut`` objects for the pins attached to the
        HX711 sensor and define the sensor object.

        .. code-block:: python

            from digitalio import DigitalInOut

            gpio_data = DigitalInOut(board.D5)
            gpio_clk = DigitalInOut(board.D6)
            hx711 = HX711_GPIO(gpio_data, gpio_clk)

        For defining the PIO subclass, you only need to use the ``board`` ``Pin`` rather than
        ``DigitalInOut`` objects.

        .. code-block:: python

            pin_data = board.D5
            pin_clk = board.D6
            hx711 = HX711_PIO(pin_data, pin_clk)

        After instantiation, you'll have access to raw ADC counts.

        .. code-block:: python

            hx711.read_raw()

        These readings are a bit more useful with an offset applied, known as a "tare" operation.
        With this complete, future ``read()`` operations will return the difference between the
        offset and the reading.

        .. code-block:: python

            hx711.tare()
            print(hx711.read())

        This ``tare()`` operation can be performed on instantation via kwarg as well.

        .. code-block:: python

            hx711 = HX711_GPIO(gpio_data, gpio_clk, tare=True)

        To return a weight in more useful units, you can determine and set a scalar value. The
        appropriate scalar for your particular load cell and unit of choice can be determined by
        adding a known weight and running ``determine_scalar(weight)``.

        .. code-block:: python

            hx711.determine_scalar(weight)
            print(hx711.scalar)

        This scalar value can be applied in the future by directly setting it, like this.

        .. code-block:: python

            hx711.scalar = new_scalar

        A scalar value can be assigned at instantiation as well.

        .. code-block:: python

            hx711 = HX711_GPIO(gpio_data, gpio_clk, scalar=new_scalar, tare=True)

        Now you can read in weight values from the scale in the same units used to determine the
        scalar value.

        .. code-block:: python

            hx711.read()
